# Digital Signal Processing

In assisting with ongoing studies of sound therapy, this ongoing project assists scientists, researchers, and [cereset](https://cereset.com/) practitioners in research related to sound and frequency by converting everyday sounds and music to their desired hertz.

## Past Research

- [The sound stimulation method and EEG change analysis for development of digital therapeutics that can stimulate the nervous system: Cortical activation and drug substitution potential](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cns.14014)
- [The Use of Binaural Beat Frequencies to Modulate the Perception of Pain](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326784313_Efficacy_of_binaural_auditory_beats_in_cognition_anxiety_and_pain_perception_a_meta-analysis)
- [Effect of Vibroacoustic Therapy on Emotional State and Quality of Life in Patients with Fibromyalgia](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09638288.2019.1687763)
- [The Effects of Music Therapy on Vital Signs, Feeding, and Sleep in Premature Infants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23589814/)
- [Electrodynamics and 528 Frequency Resonance in Water Science Helps Solve the Mystery in Homeopathy](https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-0039-1683983)

## Run project

Run 

```
python3 dsp.py
```

in your terminal to test sound conversion.

## Things to consider

- Human Hearing Range: The human ear can typically hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). The difference between 444 Hz and 528 Hz, for example, might be too subtle for most people to perceive directly, especially in shorter audio samples.
- Audio Content: The conversion process itself might not significantly alter the perceived sound depending on the audio content. If the audio primarily consists of higher frequencies, a change from 444 Hz to 528 Hz, for example, might not be noticeable.
- This project's UI is currently not compatiable on Brave.

Vizualization of audio and volume matching work is in progress, as is compatibility with Brave Browser.
